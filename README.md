# ComprehensiveDataAnalysisandModeling
Overview of the Project

carried out thorough exploratory data analysis, which included examining datasets, analyzing correlations, and displaying features to find patterns and insights.
completed data pretreatment duties by employing k-means clustering, addressing both numerical and categorical variables, and building a transformation pipeline for effective data management.

built and evaluated a number of machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and optimized their performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tweaking.
